# Robinhood Unofficial Interface for Web and Android

This jQuery-based script builds a web interface for Robinhood.com commission-free stock brokerage, enabling the user to buy, sell, and view portfolio. iPhone app is required for bank deposits and withdrawals. 

###Run as Bookmark
Create a bookmark with any name and copy the Javascript file's contents into the URL field. From desktop or mobile browser, you must click the bookmark while a Robinhood.com webpage tab is the active tab. You can also paste the Javascript code into the address bar, but manually type javascript: at the beginning of the string.

###Run HTML File
Currently the Robinhood API doesn't allow cross-origin requests, so to use the local .html file, you add --disable-web-security to the target path for your Chrome shortcut.
